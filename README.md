# falling-text
Falling text effect similar to the Matrix digital rain.

Now using the excellent dinosaur name list resource from https://github.com/junosuarez/dinosaurs

Fiddle with the code at https://jsfiddle.net/RatJuggler/5jtd0az7/

See the [football-example](https://github.com/RatJuggler/falling-text/tree/football-example) branch for a similar version using data from a JSON file.

_Note:_ Both examples use a small cache of hardcoded data whilst waiting for the main data file to load so they will still work locally without an internet connection.
